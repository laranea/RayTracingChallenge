# Readme for 'My Raytracing Challenge'
:author: Willy Clarke

== Project description

The 'Ray Tracer Challenge' is a book. It contains a specification on how to build a raytracer. The
code in this repository is my attempt to learn about raytracing in general.

The book describes a test driven method of creating the code. I have pulled in the Google Test
project. The tests have not been named so that they can be referenced from the book yet.

TODO: Rename all the Google Tests so that they can be referenced from the book.
